# face-detection-OpenCV
This repository contains code for performing face detection using Haar Cascade Frontal Face Classifiers and OpenCV. Haar Cascade classifiers are a type of machine learning object detection algorithm that can be used for real-time face detection.

## Overview
Haar Cascade Frontal Face Classifiers are widely used for face detection due to their simplicity and effectiveness. This project demonstrates how to use these classifiers with OpenCV to detect faces in images or video streams.

## Features
1. Real-time face detection using Haar Cascade Frontal Face Classifiers
2. Simple integration with existing OpenCV projects
3. Minimal dependencies
